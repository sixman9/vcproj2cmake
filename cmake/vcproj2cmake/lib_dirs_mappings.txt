# Since on Win32 Boost lib path is required for certain Boost-internal
# dependencies (specific handling via target_link_library() of individual
# dependencies will thus fail since it's insufficient),
# we need to carry it over as link_directory() as well
# (which is already the case in the original project files).
# HOWEVER, since the hardcoded lib dir naming is _specifically versioned_,
# this will break in case of FindBoost offering a different version.
# Thus translating the hardcoded dir name into BOOST_LIBRARYDIR is _required_
# (but again, possibly on Win32 only, see above).
.*/Boost/1_.*/lib:WIN32=${BOOST_LIBRARYDIR}
